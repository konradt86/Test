Sure, I'll start translating the text paragraph by paragraph.

**Monthly: nport and liquidity**

Nport:

After processing 18 copies, the main job for nport is done. The main job contains standard reports which we check.

Then we copy:

1. Liquidity monthly reporting: We check the standard reports pdf and gr.
2. Nport Supporting Dashboards: We check if they generated.
3. Guardian Liquidity Drilldown Overrides: We check the same way.

Then we send sign-off.

Toronto is responsible for sending all reports to the client 18f, nport, and liquidity.

BBH

The client has two liquidity regulations, ESMA. The two regulations are weekly and monthly.

The deadline for them is weekly 3 pm Friday for processing and shipment by 5 pm.

The monthly bd process and shipment is bd 5.

The client service is in Dublin. BBH only has external funds delivered to:

\\truviewfileshare\TruView\Clients\BBH\Miscellaneous\SourceFiles

We place the file here: \\share.truview.exch\ange\DJ-PROD\DA2\BBH\Source3\BBH\inbound and then copied to the input.

These main jobs are for ESMA and liquidity. When the reports are delivered, please do the standard checks on pdf and gr and then check from top to headers if the reports have been sent without any errors.

This will be the training for BBH and Guardian clients.
